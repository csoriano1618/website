    <p>Last week, during <a href="/post/ubucon.org">UbuCon Summit</a>, I had the pleasure to announce in sunny Pasadena a new Ubuntu Make release!
Marking the <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-make/16.01.2">16.01.2 milestone</a>, this one provides thanks to community contributions 3 new supported frameworks.</p>


<p>The first one is the new Apple's opensource language name <a href="https://swift.org/">Swift lang</a>. A lot of people are becoming more and more excited about it, and now, getting it running on Ubuntu is just a
<code>umake swift</code>
away!</p>

<p>A big thank to <a href="https://github.com/LyzardKing">Galileo Sartor</a> for bringing this support! But as any awesome community story, he didn't stop here and also implemented Eclipse php and Eclipse cpp support with this new release!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/McIntireEvan">Evan McIntire</a> also implemented (as part of Google Code In) man pages that are generated directly from the --help. Now, you can get always up to date manpage help as part of our release!</p>


<p>The video of my talk on Ubuntu Make should be shortly be online as per of Scale/Ubucon talks. Watch this space out! Meanwhile, you can find the <a href="/public/ubuntu/uld/Ubuntu_Make_UbuCon_2015.pdf">slides here</a>.</p>


<p>As usual, you can get this latest version direcly through <a href="https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-desktop/+archive/ubuntu/ubuntu-make">its ppa</a> for the 14.04 LTS, 15.04 and 15.10 ubuntu releases. Xenial version is available directly in the <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-make/15.11.2">xenial ubuntu archive</a>. This wouldn't be possible withoutl our awesome contributors community, thanks to them again!</p>

Seeing the amount of interests we saw around <a href="https://launchpad.net/quickly">Quickly</a> the past last years was really awesome!
<br /><br /><div>
Now that we have some more detailed view on how people are using the tool, it's time to collect and think about those data to see how we can improve Quickly. With all the new tools available like hangouts on air, it can be also now time to experiment how we can use them and use this opportunity to have a very open collaboration process as well as trying to attract more people to contribute to it.&nbsp;<br /><div><div><br />
More on that next week. To ensure to not miss anything, please follow the Quickly Google+ page. :)

    <p><a href="http://www.fosdem.org" hreflang="en">FOSDEM</a> was really a success with great talks, and people!
I particularly appreciated the <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2009/schedule/events/debian_tdebs" hreflang="en">Debian conference on TDeb</a><sup>[<a href="#pnote-58-1">1</a>]</sup>, <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2009/schedule/events/upstart" hreflang="en">upstart one</a> by Keybuk and <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2009/schedule/events/gnome_people_framework" hreflang="en">GNOME people framework</a> talks.<p>


<p>On saturday night, we made an "Ubuntu dinner" with the Ubuntu tribe present at the event: Italian loco-team, Romanian and Belgian one, and of course, French one! :)
After almost one hour of walk to find a restaurant that can accept 20 people, we were allowed to enjoy typical "Libanian Belgian" food. I am sure that <a href="http://www.reponses.net/blog/" hreflang="fr">Christophe</a><sup>[<a href="#pnote-58-2">2</a>]</sup> will post there some photos of strange pink food there. ;)
It was a great occasion to meet and exchange on Loco team management methods we have.</p>


<p>Finally, meeting people you know and talk with by IRC<sup>[<a href="#pnote-58-3">3</a>]</sup> was fun. I had the chance to meet the friendly <a href="http://jameswestby.net/weblog" hreflang="en">James Westby</a>, the shy <a href="http://jriddell.org/" hreflang="en">Jonathan Riddell</a>, the upstart master <a href="http://www.netsplit.com/" hreflang="en">Scott James Remnant</a>, the kindly guy <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RaphaelPinson" hreflang="fr">Raphael Pinson</a> and just quickly see <a href="https://launchpad.net/~lool" hreflang="en">Loïc Minier</a>, in addition to the unstoppable <a href="http://www.vuntz.net/" hreflang="fr">Vincent Untz</a>, the new GNOME release manager <a href="http://www.0d.be/" hreflang="fr">Frederic Peters</a>, the trolling lover (;)) <a href="https://launchpad.net/~tonio" hreflang="fr">Anthony Mercatante</a>… but those guys are already known faces for me :)<p>


<p>Ok, Fosdem is now over and I'm back home. What's next?
Ubuntu-fr will be present for the next <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GlobalBugJam" hreflang="en">global ubuntu bugs jam</a> in 2 towns in France :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse" hreflang="en">Toulouse</a></strong>, the <strong>21st Feb</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris" hreflang="en">Paris</a></strong>, the <strong>22nd Feb</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The announce is not officially done yet (it will be done in French in a couple of hours), but we will make people discover what bug triaging is, all this in a good atmosphere and harmony. Catch those bugs, join the tribe!</p>


<p>So, busy days for <a href="http://www.ubuntu-fr.org/" hreflang="fr">ubuntu-fr community</a> are coming, be ready!</p>
<div><h4>Notes</h4>
<p>[<a href="#rev-pnote-58-1">1</a>] Will Ubuntu take this for handling translation through tdeb packages, when it will be ready?<p>
<p>[<a href="#rev-pnote-58-2">2</a>] he promessed anyway<p>
<p>[<a href="#rev-pnote-58-3">3</a>] or not, but just know them ;)</p><div>

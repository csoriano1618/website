    <p>We’ve been talking about the <a href="/post/Ubuntu-loves-Developers">Ubuntu Developer Tools Center</a> for a few months now.  We’ve seen a lot of people testing it out &amp; contributing and we had a good session at the Ubuntu Online Summit about what the <a href="http://summit.ubuntu.com/uos-1411/meeting/22331/ubuntu-developer-tools-community-input/">near future holds for UDTC</a>.</p>


<p>Also during that session, emerging from  <a href="https://github.com/didrocks/ubuntu-developer-tools-center/issues/12">feedback we received</a> we talked about how “UDTC” and “Ubuntu Developer Tools Centre” is a bit of mouthfull, and the acronym is quite easy to muddle. We agreed that we needed a new name, and that’s where we need your help.</p>


<p>We’re looking for a name which succinctly describes what the Developer Tools Center is all about, its <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-developer-tools-center">values and philosophy</a>. Specifically, that we are about developing ON Ubuntu, not just FOR Ubuntu. That we strive to ensure that the tools made available via the tools center are always in line with latest version delivered by the upstream developers. That we automate the testing and validation of this, so developers can rely on us. And that use LTS releases as our environment of choice so developers have a solid foundation on which to build. In a nutshell, a name that conveys that we love developers!</p>


<p>If you have a great idea for a new name please let us know by commenting on the <a href="https://plus.google.com/+DidierRoche/posts/jWJFV4e7C8a">Google+ post</a> or by commenting on this blog post.</p>


<p>The final winner will be chosen by a group of Ubuntu contributors but please +1 your favorite to help us come up with a shortlist. The winner will receive the great honor of an Ubuntu T Shirt and knowing that they have changed history! We’ll close this contest by Monday 8th of December.</p>


<p>Now, it’s all up to you! If you want to also contribute to other parts of this ubuntu loves developers effort, <a href="/post/How-to-help-on-Ubuntu-Developer-Tools-Center">you’re more than welcome</a>!</p>

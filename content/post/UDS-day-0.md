    <p>Thanks to Canonical sponsorship program, I'm abled to attend to the <a href="http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-karmic/" hreflang="en">Ubuntu Developer Summit</a> handled at Barcelona, Spain!</p>


<p>The hostel is luxurious - especially the view from the room I share with the great "4K man" at the 15th floor, obligatory <del>screenshot</del> photo tomorrow - and the athmosphere is awesome (already met a lot of people I usally speak with in IRC). Of course, I have already hugged <a href="http://daniel.holba.ch/blog/" hreflang="en">Daniel Holbach</a>. ;)</p>


<p>Consequently, tomorrow, discussions on Ubuntu will begin. I will try to post on planet ubuntu in a daily basis in my main interests that are desktop/server/community topics.</p>


<p>For French people, there is some quite similar (but not exactly same) post entry <a href="/post/UDS%2C-day-0" hreflang="fr">here</a>.</p>

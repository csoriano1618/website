    <p>Being sad reading the GNOME reschedule <a href="http://www.gnome.org/press/releases/2011-04-gnome-3.0-rescheduled.html">announcement</a> in this 1st April 2011, I think most of people missed a very important point. That part is:
<q>We are particularly encouraging module proposals from alternate desktop shells, which will be given careful consideration.</q></p>


<p>After, talking to the GNOME release team, I'm really happy to see that they are considering now alternative desktop shells and I'm particularly excited to see a new area of cooperation with GNOME. I'm looking forward to see all those interesting discussions about unity. ;)</p>

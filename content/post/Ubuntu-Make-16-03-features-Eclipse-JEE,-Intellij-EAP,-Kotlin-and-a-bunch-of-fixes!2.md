    <p>I'm really delighted to announce a new Ubuntu Make release, scoring 16.03, bringing updates for a bunch of frameworks while introducing new support!</p>

<p>I'm also really proud as this new release features three new awesome contributors: <a href="https://github.com/Tankypon">Tankypon</a>, adding the <a href="http://superpowers-html5.com/">Superpowers</a> game editor framework, <a href="https://github.com/overbid">Eakkapat Pattarathamrong</a>, adding more tests for Visual Studio Code, and <a href="https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-make/commit/5595725fa78ac344468800895136d05640a21fef">Almeida</a>, doing some great updates to the portuguese translations!</p>


<p>The returning awesome work from <a href="https://github.com/LyzardKing">Galileo Sartor</a> an <a href="https://github.com/oijazsh">Omer Sheikh</a> got us new <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/mars2">Eclipse JEE</a> installation support, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/support/eap/">IntelliJ IDEA EAP</a> and <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin compiler</a>. In addition to those new features, we have a lot fixes for Unity3D, Android-NDK, Clang, Visual Studio Code and Intellij-based IDEs as the server counter-part changed. The usual polish and a bunch of additional smaller incremental improvements joined the party as well!

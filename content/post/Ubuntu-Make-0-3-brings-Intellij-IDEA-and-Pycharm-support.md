    <p>Thanks to the continuous awesome work of <a href="https://github.com/Tinche">Tin Tvrtković</a>, we can now cut out a new 0.3 of Ubuntu Make (<a href="/post/Ubuntu-Make%3A-the-new-Ubuntu-Developer-Tools-Center-name!">ex Ubuntu Developer Tools Center</a>).</p>


<p>This one features 2 new great IDEs (under the ide category): <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">Intellij IDEA</a> and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">Pycharm</a>, in their respective community editions. We want to thank as well the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains team</a> to have kindly provided checksums for their downloading assets so that Ubuntu Make can check the download integrity.</p>


<p>Of course, all those are backed up by tests (and this release needed some test fixes). We could as well detect thanks to those tests that Android Studio 1.0 was downloaded over http and switch that back to https.</p>


<p>All of this is in this new shiny 0.3 Ubuntu Make release, available in ubuntu vivid and in <a href="https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-desktop/+archive/ubuntu/ubuntu-make">its ppa for older ubuntu releases</a>!</p>


<p>Please note that we also moved the last piece under the new Ubuntu Make umbrella: the official github repo address is now at <a href="https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-make">https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-make</a>. We have redirections from the old address to the new one, and of course, we updated the documentation, so no reason to not contribute! Seems that <a href="https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-make/issues/56">some test web frameworks</a> can be arriving soon from our community…</p>

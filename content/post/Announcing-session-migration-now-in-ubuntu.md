<p>This small tool is trying to solve a problem we encountered for a long time as a distributor, but had to postpone it way too long because of other priorities. :)
It basically enables packagers and maintainers to migrate in user session data. Indeed, when you upgrade a package, the packaging tools are running under root permissions, and only hackish solutions was used in the past to enable us to change some parts of your user configuration<sup>[<a href="#pnote-173-1" id="rev-pnote-173-1">1</a>]</sup>, like adding the FUSA applet, adding new compiz plugins on the flyâ€¦ There are tons of example when a distribution needs to migrate some user data (logged or not when the upgrade is proceeding) without patching heavily the upstream project to add a migration support there.<p>

<p>This tool is executed at session startup, in a sync fashion. It contains caching and tries to execute the minimal chunk<sup>[<a href="#pnote-173-2" id="rev-pnote-173-2">2</a>]</sup>, based on the design of the excellent <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gconf/tree/gsettings/gsettings-data-convert.c">gconf-&gt;gsettings migration</a> tool. It contains as well a dh-migrations package, with a debhelper hook (<code>--with migrations</code> calling <code>dh_migrations</code>), so that client desktop packages just have to ship a <code>debian/&lt;package&gt;.migrations</code> file linking to their migration scripts which will be shipped in the right directory. We can even imagine in the near future that when you install such a package, you end up with a notification that a session restart is necessary (and not a full reboot). Note as well that the migration happens per user and per session, so it's really important that the scripts are idempotents.<p>


<p>Was 3 days of fun coding this. ;) All of the C and perl codes are covered by a short, but complete testsuite run during the package build, so no breakage hopefully. ;) Associated man pages are <a href="man:session-migration">session-migration</a> and <a href="man:dh_migrations">dh_migrations</a>.</p>

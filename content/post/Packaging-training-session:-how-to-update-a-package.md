    <p>As already posted on <a href="http://ubuntupackaging.wordpress.com/2009/04/15/second-packaging-training-session/" hreflang="en">planet ubuntu</a>, do not forget to attend this lesson if you want to learn an usual way to update a package, how to avoid typical traps, plus some additional hints and hidden bonus points :)</p>


<p>If you want to follow the session and practice a little, it's better that you get some downloaded packages:</p>


<blockquote><p>sudo apt-get install build-essential devscripts ubuntu-dev-tools debhelper diff patch quilt fakeroot lintian libtool gnome-common gnome-doc-utils gtk-doc-tools</p>
<p>
You should also have "deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jaunty main restricted" in your /etc/apt/sources.list (and then sudo apt-get update).</p></blockquote>


<p>Ready? The session is scheduled for: <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=4&amp;day=16&amp;year=2009&amp;hour=18&amp;min=0&amp;sec=0&amp;p1=0" hreflang="en">16th April, 18:00 UTC</a>, and it will take place in <a href="javascript:void(0);" hreflang="en">#ubuntu-classroom on irc.freenode.net</a>.</p>

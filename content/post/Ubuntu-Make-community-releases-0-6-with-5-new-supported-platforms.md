    <p>What always inspires me in my work is that community participation is at heart of what we are doing, and that’s what help us waking up everyday. Anybody can dive and fix small typos, bugs, or even bring big features to the table! This is exactly what happened with this new <a href="https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-make/commit/0ecef0e525e58a51940ef5e8935847cec5b63bf3">Ubuntu Make 0.6</a> release, entirely backed by community participation!</p>


<p>In addition to zsh support, you will find 5 new jetbrains IDE supported into the “ide” Ubuntu Make category, which are:
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-educational/">PyCharm educational edition</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html">PyCharm professional</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a> and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a>! Those new ones align nicely and complete the already supported 10 platforms in Ubuntu Make, totalising thus (if I can do maths) 15 of them! Remember we started the vivid cycle with only one platform supported as it was about building solid foundations and helpers in the tool so that such contributions can exist. :) I guess there has never been a better time to be a developer using Ubuntu as their OS!</p>


<p>I was delighted to see such big contributions being posted as <a href="https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-make/pull/73">a pull requests</a> by <a href="https://github.com/syndbg">Anton Antonov</a> without much more to do afterwards than slight adjustments. This testified that the overall frameworks (and tests infra as well) is easy enough to grock and that’s a huge source of satisfaction for us! I was even more excited to see that another community member who did a lot of work on Ubuntu Make (<a href="https://github.com/Tinche">Tin Tvrtković</a>) helped on the review and gave great advice!</p>


<p>Great work team! That’s the kind of things that made my day. All those niceties and excellent contributions are available as of now in Ubuntu Make 0.6 in Vivid, as well, through <a href="https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-desktop/+archive/ubuntu/ubuntu-make">its ppa</a>, to 14.04 LTS and 14.10 ubuntu releases.</p>

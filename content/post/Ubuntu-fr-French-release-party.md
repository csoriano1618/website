    <p>On 30th October, it was time to celebrate the new Koala invasion!</p>


<p>Contrary to our <a href="/post/UDS-day-1-and-4K-people-in-Ubuntu-Party-Paris-%3B%29" hreflang="en">Ubuntu Party</a> (next one will be in Paris on <a href="http://ubuntu-party.org/paris_karmic" hreflang="fr">28 and 29th November</a>) opened to any kind of public and especially computer science non specialist, we also have at each release a dinner in Paris with few people more or less in the FLOSS ecosystem. 51 persons came this time and enjoying sharing good time with friends.</p>


<p>It was also the perfect time to have some little meetings to prepare all futur (and past) ubuntu-fr events and actions (I'll speak about them in my next post, coming soon!).

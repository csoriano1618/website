    <p>Last Friday, ubuntu-fr had our release party in Paris, gathering a whole bunch of Ubuntu Party organizers. There were some added <a href="http://www.mozilla-europe.org">Mozilla contributors</a> and <a href="http://www.april.org/" hreflang="fr">April</a> members.</p>

<p>It was great to share with more than 30 people this dinner, composed of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarte_flamb%C3%A9e" hreflang="en">flammekueche</a>. Jokes and discussions/trolls on the new release were part of the party, of course! :)</p>


<p>There were a birthday feist next to our group and can you guess what they got as an unexpected present? Exactly! An jaunty CD and an Ubuntu Party flyer with no extra charge. ;)</p>

Next round? The <a href="http://www.ubuntu-party.org/" hreflang="fr">Ubuntu Party</a> in Paris, dedicated to a larger audience, with conferences, installations, training sessions, multimedia demonstrations, animation, events… and lots more!</p>


<p>We had 3000 flyers for free<sup>[<a href="#pnote-78-1">1</a>]</sup> and distributed them during Solution Linux. Hope to see a lot of people there!<p>

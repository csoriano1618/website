    <p>Hot from the builders, we just cut a big release of <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-make/0.5">Ubuntu Make 0.5</a> bringing fresh new support to a bunch of IDEs and programming languages! Web developers will see great enhancements in this release, but other developers are not left out!</p>


<p>We welcome first a new “web” category which is hosting <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/">Dart</a> support now! Dartlang fans would be able to get the editor and sdk installed, registered in the OS and added to the launcher in a simple command!</p>


<p><code> umake dart</code></p>


<p>and you are ready to go!</p>


<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer/">Firefox Developer Edition</a> is now available as well under the same new “Web” category. Installing and getting a great environment for your web development is just a command away on Ubuntu!</p>


<p>The JetBrains suite got its <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">Idea Ultimate edition</a> support thanks to another excellent contribution from <a href="https://github.com/Tinche">Tin Tvrtković</a>. He already fixed other jetbrains support if you were redirected (based on location) over the ftp download.</p>


<p><a href="https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-make/issues/47">Another request</a> was to add <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html">Android NDK</a> support. Your wish is now fulfilled under the Android category!</p>


<p>In addition to this, we merged latest translations coming from the community, thanks to all of you contributing to it! Please note that due to those new categories, there are new strings to be translated. It’s a nice way to get your <a href="/post/How-to-help-on-Ubuntu-Developer-Tools-Center">first contribution</a> to ubuntu make just awaiting for you!</p>

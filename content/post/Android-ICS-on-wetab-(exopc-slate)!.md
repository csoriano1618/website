    <p>Spend few hours installing Android ICS (<a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/">Cyanogenmod</a> built for x86) on my <a href="http://wetab.mobi/en/">exopc</a> tablet and playing with it.</p>


<p>I've never been impressed by <a href="https://meego.com/">Meego</a> installed on it as a developer preview, performance and feature-wise. I've found yesterday evening <a href="http://corvusmod.wordpress.com/2012/01/24/android-ics-4-0-3-for-wetab-english/">those instructions and links</a> about a corvusmod rebuild of cynagenmod and I gave it a try! Of course, as this is not an arm device but x86 one, not a lot of applications are working out of the box, but overall, the UI is totally functional and browsing the web is a delightful experience.</p>

After migrating to a <a href="http://www.google.fr/nexus/">google nexus phone</a> (my previous phone had android 2.2), I'm now full ICS at home and I love it! Well done Android team for taking hard decisions and focusing on the user experience itself<sup>[<a href="#pnote-171-1" id="rev-pnote-171-1">1</a>]</sup>. This tremendous turn on having coherent and well-designed UI gave a lot of credits to the whole OS. Everything is now smooth on my phone AND my tablet and I love the whole ecosystem integration. :)<p>


<p>I hope we will be able to deliver the same kind of experience on ubuntu, coherent and centralized ecosystem where going from one device to another is almost seamless. I noted as well that the base OS image is only ~170 Mb. I wonder if we could achieve something similar seeing for how many releases we stroke to find enough space on the old 700Mb limitationâ€¦ I guess we will have to take <a href="http://digitizor.com/2010/02/05/openoffice-dropped-from-ubuntu-netbook-edition-10-04/">drastic decisions</a>, but this time, <a href="http://mybroadband.co.za/news/software/11520-openoffice-back-in-ubuntu.html">keep them straight</a> as we already tried 2 years ago with the netbook edition flavor :)</p>

<p>[<a href="#rev-pnote-171-1" id="pnote-171-1">1</a>] And I'm really happy that at Canonical, we are currently doing the same on Ubuntu</p><div>
